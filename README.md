=== PetWash ===
(in development)

- CLIENT | Bootstrap JavaScript SCSS CSS HTML
- SERVER | Python Django API

Final project for the Python Developer Course at Ultima School which I'm taking. 

- This system allows users to book a pet bath on a specific day. The limit of time slots of each day is respected.

- There are some animal categories that can be bathed

- There is an index page and a contact page where users can book the bath. On the contact page, they need to select an available day, an animal category and input some personal data (name, cell phone) in case PetWash needs to make contact.

- PetWash managers need a page where they can check the pets that were booked on the current day or another one selected - it can be an admin page.

- On the API there must be a way to select a pet category and see a list of the pets that were bathed along the previous month. They can use this data to make promos.

- Also, the API should allow the creation of a new schedule.
